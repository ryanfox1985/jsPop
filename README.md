<h1>jsPop</h1>

Go to the <a href="jspop.bytecrawl.com">Project page</a> and see jsPop in action.

jsPop is a javascript tool based on jQuery that provides overlayed boxes ( pop-ups ) to load contents on it.

I wrote this tool because the tools I knew to display overlayed pop-ups were focused on image gallery, like
<a href="https://github.com/jackmoore/colorbox">Colorbox</a> or <a href="http://fancybox.net">fancyBox</a> do.

jsPop is focused on providing those overlayed pop-ups without the fancy stuff of an image gallery. It's a raw
pop-up with no additional UI elements so you don't have to spend time removing the features you don't need of a
gallery navigator.

jsPop may be useful for you if you intend to <b>load and display html contents</b> via AJAX or hidden HTML tags,
in an overlayed pop-up.
